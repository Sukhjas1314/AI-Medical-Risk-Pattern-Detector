# 🏥 AI-Based Medical Risk Pattern Detector

> **Early Detection of Medical Negligence & Care-Process Risks using AI**

---

## 📌 Overview

Medical negligence and patient safety risks often occur **not because of incorrect diagnosis**, but due to **delays, missed follow-ups, or deviations from standard care procedures**.  
Unfortunately, such issues are usually identified **after significant harm has already occurred**.

This project introduces an **AI-powered clinical safety monitoring system** that proactively analyzes **patient treatment timelines and clinical events** to detect early warning signs of potential medical negligence.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

In modern healthcare systems, most software solutions focus on **record management and diagnosis support**, while lacking intelligent mechanisms to analyze **care-process quality**.

Delays in follow-up tests, missed treatments, or abnormal clinical sequences often go unnoticed until adverse outcomes occur. There is a critical need for a **proactive, explainable, and non-diagnostic decision-support system** that can monitor treatment workflows and flag potential risks early.

This project aims to design and develop an **AI-Based Early Medical Negligence & Risk Pattern Detection System** that identifies deviations in treatment timelines and clinical actions, helping healthcare stakeholders improve patient safety and care quality.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze patient treatment timelines and clinical events
- Detect delayed, missing, or abnormal care actions
- Generate explainable risk alerts
- Provide a preventive decision-support mechanism
- Improve healthcare safety without diagnosing diseases

---
