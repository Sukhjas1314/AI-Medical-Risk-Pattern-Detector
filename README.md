_🏥🩺 **AI-Medical-Risk-Pattern-Detector** 😷_

In healthcare systems, medical negligence and patient safety risks often arise not from incorrect diagnosis, but from delays, missed follow-ups, and deviations from standard care procedures. These issues are typically identified only after significant harm has occurred, due to the absence of proactive monitoring mechanisms.

Existing healthcare software systems focus primarily on record-keeping and diagnosis support, but lack intelligent tools to analyze treatment timelines and detect early warning signs of care-process risks.

This project aims to design and develop an AI-based Early Medical Negligence and Risk Pattern Detection System that analyzes patient treatment timelines, clinical events, and follow-up actions to identify potential risk patterns such as delayed tests, missing treatments, and abnormal care sequences.

The system functions as a clinical safety decision-support tool, providing explainable risk alerts without performing diagnosis or treatment recommendations. Its goal is to enable early intervention, improve care quality, and reduce preventable medical harm.
